    longDescription: >
      The jEAP Process Archive Service (PAS) is a service template library that provides a way to archive artifacts pertaining
      to a process. Such artifacts might be required to be archived for audit purposes or due to business requirements.
      Process artifact archival is triggered by domain events, and artifacts can either be derived from the event's payload
      or fetched from a business service using its REST API.
    features:
      - Archives process-related artifacts based on domain events
      - Supports artifact data extraction from event payloads or external REST APIs
