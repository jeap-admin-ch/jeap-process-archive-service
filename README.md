# jEAP Process Archive Service

The jEAP Process Archive Service (PAS) is a service template library that provides a way to archive artifacts pertaining
to a process. Such artifacts might be required to be archived for audit purposes or due to business requirements.

Process artifact archival is triggered by domain events, and artifacts can either be derived from the event's payload
or fetched from a business service using its REST API.
